Everyday, I try to dress for the occasion. If I'm going to visit friends, I generally dress casually. I wear jeans, and I might throw on a t-shirt. In the case of a date, I usually wear a nice dress shirt-, but nothing too formal. In the past, I made it a habit to dress up for work in a suit and a tie because it was important to give a good impression, but more people are dressing down in the workplace, and this is more accepted now. When I exercise, I generally wear some shorts and a shirt, and I put on comfortable shoes. Overall, I think new fashions are replacing traditional ones, but I also think we should also try to preserve typical traditional clothing. It's a part of our culture and heritage.
